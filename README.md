# Machine Learning Projects: Document Clustering and Retrieval

Use similarity-based algorithms to retrieve similar documents
-Create a document retrieval system using k-nearest neighbors, with improvement using KD-trees or locality sensitive hashing.
-Identify various similarity metrics for text data. 
-Cluster documents by topic using k-means; parallelize k-means using MapReduce. â€¨-Probabilistic clustering using mixtures models, such as Gaussian mixture model
-Perform mixed membership modeling using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and Gibbs sampler

Project: Document clustering and retrieval using text data from Wikipedia pages on people (NLP,  bag of words, TF-IDF, similarity measure, nearest neighbors )
